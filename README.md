# Cosmetx
This allows you to gain access to all cosmetics, including the unobtainable ones! \
`Client-side only!`

## How it works!
In DnSpy you can find out where the cosmetics are handled.
So in GorillaNetworking.CosmeticsController.GetUserCosmeticsAllowed() you can apply a patch that gives you all cosmetics.
